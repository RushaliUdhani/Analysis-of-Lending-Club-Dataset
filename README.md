# Analysis-of-Lending-Club-Dataset

In this case, we introduced a fictional character, Mar the regulator who may be interested in working with Lending club. He has hired our consulting team to analyze the Lending club dataset to achieve its specific goals. Mar is a regulator who regulates how the model can be used/not used.

**Task 1:**

Framing: Understanding your client, available data and exploratory data analysis: Our first task is to understand your client, the Lending club platform, the loan statistics and the investor performance. Here we summarized the client needs and educated him about the dataset.

**Task 2:**

Data preparation Data cleansing, Pre-processing, Feature engineering : Did it using Feature tools and manual feature engineering

**Task 3:**

Prediction We built 3 models (Regression, Random forest, Neural Networks) to predict interest rates. We used MAPE on all these models Applied 5fold cross validation

**Task 4:**

Part 1 Hyper-parameter optimization We did Hyper-parameter tuning for all the three models using the following hyper parameters-- Regression: Try L1, L2, Elasticnet regularization b. Neural networks: Change epochs, optimizers, learning rate c. Random forest: No of trees, Tree depth

**Task 4:**

Part 2 AutoML We used- a. TPOT b. AutSKLearn c. H2o.ai
And summarized the MAPE for each model.

**Task 5:**

Analysis We Built out test cases to test out use cases that are important for our client.
